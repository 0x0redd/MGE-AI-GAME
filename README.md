# Asteroid Sprint

Asteroid Sprint is an innovative game where you navigate through falling asteroids using hand gestures detected via keypoints, offering a unique, controller-free gameplay experience.

This project was developed by the Computer Science Club, proudly representing Moulay Ismail University. Asteroid Sprint was showcased at the Moroccan Gaming Expo as part of the club's commitment to pushing the boundaries of interactive entertainment and demonstrating the potential of AI-driven controls in gaming.
